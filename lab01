Lab #1: Data Types & Conversions


Problem Statement: The goal is to perform some basic conversions to ASCII, EBCDIC, decimal, binary, and hexadecimal. Search for these conversion tables / definitions in your browser. You should understand how to mathematically make these conversions on your own.

Instructions: Answer the following questions (Do some research):

Define hexadecimal notation. (2 points)
A number system of base16 going from [0-F]

Define binary notation. (2 points)
A number system of base2 going from [0-1] 

What is ASCII? (2 points)
	ASCII is the  American Standard Code for Information Interchange which has the job of assigning numerical values to characters. 

What is EBCDIC? (2 points)
EBCDID stands for Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code and was used by IBMs mainframe computers. 

Convert the phrase “Hello, friend!” to decimal using an ASCII table (perhaps http://www.asciitable.com/).  You can exclude the quotation marks, but remember to include the punctuation and spaces.  Include spaces between each character. (7 points)

72 101 108 108 111 44 32 102 114 105 101 110 100 33

Convert the phrase “Hello, friend!” to decimal using an EBCDIC table (https://www.cs.umd.edu/~meesh/cmsc311/clin-cmsc311/Lectures/lecture6/ebcdic.html ). You can exclude the quotation marks, but remember to include the punctuation and spaces. (7 points)

Convert the phrase “This class is great!” to hexadecimal using an ASCII table. You can exclude the quotation marks, but remember to include the punctuation and spaces. (10 points)

54 68 69 73 20 63 6C 61 73 73 20 69 73 20 67 72 65 61 74 21

Convert the hexadecimal number “ff” to binary and decimal. (2 points)

11111111
255

Convert the network mask 255.255.255.128 to hexadecimal. Ignore the dots. (4 points)


Convert the binary number 00101101 to decimal and hexadecimal. (2 points)
45, 0x2c

Using Device Manager (Windows) or System Info (Mac), find an example of where a hexadecimal number is represented.  Explain what you found. (2 points)
MAC address of bluetooth device


What is your major? (If you haven’t declared a major yet, what do you plan to major in?) (1 point)
cybersecurity

Find an example of how data conversion or its representation apply to your career field. (For example, explain how hex is relevant to forensics, game programming, CSI or Cybersecurity.)  Provide the reference to where you found the information. This should just be short summary, around 500 words. (4 points)
	because each hex digit corresponds to four binary digits it converts much easier and therefore is often representing binary data on computers for humans to read.
